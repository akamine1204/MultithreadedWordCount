In other words, a database has some degree of interaction with events in the real world and an audience that is actively interested in its contents. The users of a database may perform some transaction or events may happen. For example, a studentâ€™s marks are increased on an exam, which causes the information in the database to change. For the database to be considered reliable these changes must be reflected in the database as soon as possible, so it can remain a true reflection of the mini-world that it represents.
